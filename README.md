# OSdiscordBot
An open source discord bot I am developing. The goal is to make a bot that you can easily self-host, without having to pay to unlock features.

# Instructions
this is currently very basic, I am planning to add more functionality. But if you want to use it in it's early stages, here you go:
1. run `git clone https://github.com/MythicalFlame/OSdiscordBot.git`
2. change the options `clientId` and `token` in `/src/config.json`
3. cd into the src directory and then run `node update-commands.js`
